Python-automated JustinGuitar timer

This is a Python-script that automates the JustinGuitar timer for not having to set the interval times in every practice session. 
It is configurable with the intervals.txt file. Just write your times in every line of the txt file and start the script. 
Chrome will start up and set up your first interval and start it.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.7
- Selenium
